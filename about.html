          This project begins with a simple question: what happens to language when the body can’t keep up?
          At RISD, studio life is built around constant talking — crits, instructions, jokes, panic, reassurance.
          But after enough nights of “just one more hour,” speech stops arriving as meaning.
          It arrives as fragments.
        </p>

        <p>
          This website behaves like a listener that gets tired.
          It doesn’t fall silent — it becomes selective.
          It holds onto small, familiar words (“the”, “a”, “an”) and sometimes lets go of what follows.
          The way attention slips when you’re running on fumes.
        </p>

        <p>
          How it works, plainly:
          Your browser converts speech into text.
          When a phrase completes, it is placed into the page.
          Depending on the selected sleep state (8h / 4h / 1h), the text shifts —
          becoming heavier or thinner, clearer or less reliable.
          Some parts remain. Others disappear.
